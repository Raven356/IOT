# Lab3


# Project overview
The task is to develop a comprehensive system for monitoring and analyzing the condition of road surfaces. This system is capable of collecting data on various parameters such as unevenness, cracks, potholes, and other defects that may affect the quality of the road. The collected data must be analyzed to identify patterns and trends that can help in predicting maintenance needs for the road network. The system could also generate reports and alerts for relevant authorities and/or drivers. 

# Goal
The goal of this system is to enhance road safety, reduce maintenance costs, and improve the overall driving experience for motorists.

# Task 
To store and access data, it is necessary to implement the Store API, which will store analyzed data in a database. Additionally, a method for obtaining new data for UI clients was implemented. The implementation done using Python.
