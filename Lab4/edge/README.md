# Lab4


# Project overview
The objective remains to develop a comprehensive system for monitoring and analyzing road surface conditions. This iteration focuses on implementing the edge data logic, which involves analyzing data from vehicle sensors, determining the road condition, and sending the analyzed data to the Hub. 

# System components
The system is designed to improve road safety, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance the driving experience by monitoring various road surface parameters such as unevenness, cracks, and potholes.

# System architecture
Similar to previous iterations, the system includes components such as the agent module, primary data processing module, data accumulation module, store, and visualization module.

# Task
The specific challenge for laboratory work â„–4 is to implement the edge data logic. This involves collecting data via MQTT, analyzing road conditions, and forwarding this data to the Hub.
